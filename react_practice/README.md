<!-- DIRECTIONS JAN 8 -->
<!--

goal: to turn button green
Add a hook or state to your component that starts with the default “green”
Add a classname to the button that uses the hook you just made to say what the class is
Add css for the classname in your css - classname “green” to background: green - classname “red” to red
Define a function in the component that changes the string saved in your hook or state from green to red
Set that function as the onclick for the button -->

#
# pick a number,
# try each number,
# with number 1 cut up each length see how many lengths you get, you'd get 45 for the first, you'd get 45 + 110
# figure out the remainder thats what you're disacrding
# calculate profit which is the number of rods times 1 times the saleprice - cost per cut times cuts made
#
#
#
#
# loop thru lengths
# cut up numbers
# count how many rods have at end
# multiply them by the cost per cost
#
# keep track of how many cuts made
# how many rods that are same length
# multiply length of rods by saleprice

# fuck you asshole thats not what i justa sked you
# what was the exact question iasked you that you said was already in here

# what do you do with that try not to be an asshole and just explain it


remainder = 22 / 5
